Description: Implements methods for modeling and detecting change points
    in time series data using a Bayesian state-space approach with dynamic
    shrinkage.  The model utilizes a autoregressive stochastic volatility
    process within a time-varying parameter model to estimate smoothly
    varying trends with large, isolated interruptions. Change points are
    estimated using a threshold parameter.  The model can deal with
    heteroscedastic measurement error, and jointly identifies both local
    outliers and change points.
